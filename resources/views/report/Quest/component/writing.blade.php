                <b>And we come to our last step, an area that is at the forefront of many of your university
                    applications,
                    the writing section a.k.a essays!</b>, While you may not realize it, the difference between an
                AI-generated essay and one crafted by humans can still be easily spotted! A few indicators that make
                them
                very distinguishable:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-lower-latin">
                <li>
                    <b>Lack of Personal Depth:</b>
                    AI-generated essays often miss out on personal stories or insights that come from real-life
                    experiences,
                    making them lack a unique perspective.
                    <p>
                        They also tend to fall short in conveying emotions, which humans can express more effectively
                        through
                        language or direct sharing of feelings. This gives the essay more emotional depth, making their
                        writing
                        more engaging and relatable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can do this by including dialogue in your essay as it also shows emotional depth:
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <b>Overly General or Vague Content:</b>
                    AI-written essays can often be too broad or shallow. They might not
                    dive deep into a topic or offer detailed views like a human writer would, who knows a lot about the
                    subject and has their own opinions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Repetitiveness:</b>
                    AI-written texts can sometimes repeat ideas or words because AI struggles to come up with a wide
                    range
                    of different ideas. On the other hand, people usually write in a more creative and varied way,
                    sharing
                    thoughts in unique styles.
