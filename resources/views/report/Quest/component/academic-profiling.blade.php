                As you know, universities from the UK, Australia, and even from Asian countries take academic scores
                very
                seriously. This doesn’t mean they will only look at how high your scores are, <b>but also the subjects
                    you
                    select.</b>
            </P>

            <p>
                <b>So what is the next step?</b>
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    First, make sure what major grouping you want, it doesn’t have to be specific, but knowing in
                    general
                    what you are aiming for will definitely help!
                    <br>
                    For example, you want to do something related to Biology. However, you don’t know what
                    specialization
                    you want to take later on such as biomedicine, biotechnology, etc. From there you can just pick, in
                    general, Biology or opt for Science first. Don’t worry, these are only for research purposes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    From there take time to check the academic entry requirements for that major on the official
                    university
                    website. If you still feel confused, email an admission officer to get more information. Better safe
                    than sorry!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Be very careful as some universities are very strict and detailed with the subjects they ask for,
                    such
                    as for the IBDP curriculum asking if the applicant took Higher Level (HL) or Standard Level (SL)
                    from
                    their subjects,
                    <p>
                        Excerpt:

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Or with the Cambridge curriculum asking if they took A levels or AS levels.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Excerpt:

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once that is done, be sure to also consult with your parents or counselor to see which is the best
                    fit
                    for your abilities and dreams.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With this you are now prepared from the beginning, and with the correct subjects it’s all about
                    focusing
                    on getting that great score. From there it’ll be smooth sailing!
