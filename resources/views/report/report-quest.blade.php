        <div class="daily-schedule">
            <p>
                Let’s upgrade that schedule! Many universities will be interested in what you’ve done and always look at
                the
                amount of your activities
            </p>
            <p>
                While the end results of your efforts is definitely a plus, the process towards achieving that can also
                be
                documented to showcase your persistence and hard work!
            </p>
            <p>
                Even doing something as simple as your hobbies will count towards something, so invest more in doing
                various
                pastimes that will be beneficial for admissions and preparing you for university life.
            </p>

            <ul>
                For Example:
                <li>
                    Doing sports like football, tennis, etc, shows your ability in teamwork
                </li>
                <li>
                    Doing hobbies like crocheting or cooking shows your ability to be patient
                </li>
                <li>
                    Helping out with family errands or running their business shows your ability to be responsible
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Many of these activities can be inserted in your application later on!

                Starting to pick your dream country or university shouldn’t be complicated!
            </p>
            <p>
                When choosing where to study abroad, start by looking into different countries and universities that
                offer
                programs related to your interests. But it's not just about the courses; <b>the culture and lifestyle of
                    the
                    place</b> are super important too. Imagine living there—does it feel right to you?
            </p>
            <p>
                Language is another big thing to consider. Will you be comfortable speaking the language used there,
                both in
                and out of class? And then there's the money aspect. Look at how much it will cost for tuition and
                living
                expenses. Can you manage it, or are there scholarships you can apply for?
            </p>
            <p>
                You'll also need to check out the nitty-gritty details like admission requirements and what you need to
                do
                to get a visa. It's a good idea to chat with people who've been there and done that—alumni or current
                students can give you the real scoop on what it's like.
            </p>
            <p>
                Think about your future too. <b>What kind of job opportunities are there in that country after you
                    graduate?</b>
                And if it's possible, try to visit the place before you make your final decision. Nothing beats
                experiencing
                it firsthand to see if it truly feels like the right fit for you.
